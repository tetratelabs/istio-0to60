# Istio 0 to 60 Workshop labs

This repository contains the labs for the Istio 0 to 60 workshop.

First deliveries of this workshop took place in early 2022.
The labs are tested against each new release of Istio, and have been refined and updated over time.
New labs have been added that go beyond the original "0 to 60" scope.

The labs are published on GitHub pages [here](https://tetratelabs.github.io/istio-0to60/).
