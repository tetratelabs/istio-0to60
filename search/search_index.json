Revise the Istio installation configuration \u00b6 Modify the installation of Istio to use the demo profile which enables high levels of tracing, which is convenient for this lab. istioctl install --set profile = demo Install Fortio \u00b6 Let us try and generate some load to the web-frontend workload and see the distribution of responses.

Save the above file to fortio.yaml and deploy it: kubectl apply -f fortio.yaml Make a single request to make sure everything is working: kubectl exec deploy/fortio -c fortio -- fortio curl web-frontend The above command should result in an HTTP 200 \"OK\" response from the web-frontend app. With fortio, we can generate a load of 50 requests with two concurrent connections like this: kubectl exec deploy/fortio -c fortio -- \\ fortio load -c 2 -qps 0 -n 50 -quiet web-frontend All 50 requests should succeed. That is the meaning of Code 200 : 50 in the output. Info Fortio also has a GUI, to access it: Port-forward the deployment's port kubectl port-forward deploy/fortio 8080 In a browser, visit http://localhost:8080/fortio Circuit breaker - connection pool settings \u00b6 Study the following DestionationRule: cb-web-frontend.yaml 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 apiVersion : networking.istio.io/v1alpha3 kind : DestinationRule metadata : name : web-frontend spec : host : web-frontend.default.svc.cluster.local trafficPolicy : connectionPool : http : http1MaxPendingRequests : 1 # (1) http2MaxRequests : 1 # (2) maxRequestsPerConnection : 1 # (3) The maximum number of pending HTTP requests to a destination. The maximum number of concurrent requests to a destination. The maximum number of requests per connection. It configures the connection pool for web-frontend with very low thresholds, to easily trigger the circuit breaker. Save the above YAML to cb-web-frontend.yaml and apply the changes: kubectl apply -f cb-web-frontend.yaml Since all values are set to 1, we won't trigger the circuit breaker if we send the request using one connection and one request per second. If we increase the number of connections and send more requests (i.e. 2 workers sending requests concurrently, and sending 50 requests), we'll start getting errors. The errors happen because the http2MaxRequests is set to 1 and we have more than 1 concurrent request being sent. Additionally, we're exceeding the maxRequestsPerConnection limit. kubectl exec deploy/fortio -c fortio -- \\ fortio load -c 2 -qps 0 -n 50 -quiet web-frontend ... Code 200 : 24 (48.0 %) Code 503 : 26 (52.0 %) Tip To reset the metric counters, run: kubectl exec deploy/fortio -c istio-proxy -- curl -sX POST localhost:15000/reset_counters The x-envoy-overloaded header \u00b6 When a request is dropped due to circuit breaking, the response will contain a response header x-envoy-overloaded with value \"true\". One way to see this header is to run a fortio load with two concurrent connections in one terminal for a couple of minutes: kubectl exec deploy/fortio -c fortio -- \\ fortio load -c 2 -qps 0 -t 2m --allow-initial-errors -quiet http://web-frontend In a separate terminal, invoke a single request: kubectl exec deploy/fortio -c fortio -- fortio curl http://web-frontend Here is an example response to a dropped request: > HTTP/1.1 503 Service Unavailable > x-envoy-overloaded: true > content-length: 81 > content-type: text/plain > date: Thu, 10 Aug 2023 18:25:37 GMT > server: envoy > > upstream connect error or disconnect/reset before headers. reset reason: overflowcommand terminated with exit code 1 Then press Ctrl + C to interrupt the load generation. Observe failures in Zipkin \u00b6 Open the Zipkin dashboard: istioctl dash zipkin In the Zipkin UI, list failing traces by clicking the \"+\" button in the search field and specifying the query: tagQuery=error . Then click the Run Query button. Pick a failing trace to view the details. The requests are failing because the circuit breaker is tripped. Response flags are set to UO (Upstream Overflow) and the status code is 503 (service unavailable). Prometheus metrics \u00b6 Another option is looking at the Prometheus metrics directly. Open the Prometheus dashboard: istioctl dash prometheus Apply the following PromQL query: envoy_cluster_upstream_rq_pending_overflow { app = \" fortio \", cluster_name = \" outbound|80||web-frontend.default.svc.cluster.local \"} The query shows the metrics for requests originating from the fortio app and going to the web-frontend service. The upstream_rq_pending_overflow and other metrics are described in the Envoy documentation . Noteworthy are circuit-breaking specific metrics showing the state of various circuit breakers. For example rq_open indicates whether the \"requests\" circuit breaker is open, and its companion remaining_rq indicates how many requests remain to trip the corresponding circuit breaker. We can also look at the metrics directly from the istio-proxy container in the Fortio Pod: kubectl exec deploy/fortio -c istio-proxy -- \\ pilot-agent request GET stats | grep web-frontend | grep pending cluster.outbound|80||web-frontend.default.svc.cluster.local.circuit_breakers.default.remaining_pending: 1 cluster.outbound|80||web-frontend.default.svc.cluster.local.circuit_breakers.default.rq_pending_open: 0 cluster.outbound|80||web-frontend.default.svc.cluster.local.circuit_breakers.high.rq_pending_open: 0 cluster.outbound|80||web-frontend.default.svc.cluster.local.upstream_rq_pending_active: 0 cluster.outbound|80||web-frontend.default.svc.cluster.local.upstream_rq_pending_failure_eject: 0 cluster.outbound|80||web-frontend.default.svc.cluster.local.upstream_rq_pending_overflow: 26 cluster.outbound|80||web-frontend.default.svc.cluster.local.upstream_rq_pending_total: 24 Info Yet another convenient way to look at the stats emitted by an Envoy sidecar is via the Envoy dashboard: istioctl dashboard envoy deploy/fortio In the web ui, click on the \"stats\" endpoint, and filter by target outbound cluster \"web-frontend\". Resolving the errors \u00b6 To resolve these errors, we can adjust the circuit breaker settings. Increase the maximum number of concurrent requests to 2 ( http2MaxRequests ), as shown below: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 apiVersion : networking.istio.io/v1alpha3 kind : DestinationRule metadata : name : web-frontend spec : host : web-frontend.default.svc.cluster.local trafficPolicy : connectionPool : http : http1MaxPendingRequests : 1 http2MaxRequests : 2 maxRequestsPerConnection : 1 Save the above YAML to cb-web-frontend.yaml and apply the changes: kubectl apply -f cb-web-frontend.yaml If we re-run Fortio with the same parameters, we'll notice less failures this time: kubectl exec deploy/fortio -c fortio -- \\ fortio load -c 2 -qps 0 -n 50 -quiet web-frontend ... Code 200 : 39 (78.0 %) Code 503 : 11 (22.0 %) Since we're sending more than 1 request per connection, we can increase the maxRequestsPerConnection to 2: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 apiVersion : networking.istio.io/v1alpha3 kind : DestinationRule metadata : name : web-frontend spec : host : web-frontend.default.svc.cluster.local trafficPolicy : connectionPool : http : http1MaxPendingRequests : 1 http2MaxRequests : 2 maxRequestsPerConnection : 2 Save the above YAML to cb-web-frontend.yaml and apply the changes: kubectl apply -f cb-web-frontend.yaml If we re-run Fortio this time, we'll get zero or close to zero HTTP 503 responses. Even if we increase the number of requests per second, we should only get a small number of 503 responses. To get rid of the remaining failing requests, we can increase the http1MaxPendingRequests to 2: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 apiVersion : networking.istio.io/v1alpha3 kind : DestinationRule metadata : name : web-frontend spec : host : web-frontend.default.svc.cluster.local trafficPolicy : connectionPool : http : http1MaxPendingRequests : 2 http2MaxRequests : 2 maxRequestsPerConnection : 2 With these settings (assuming 2 concurrent connections), we can easily handle a higher number of requests. To be clear, the numbers we used in settings are just examples and are not realistic - we set them intentionally low to make the circuit breaker easier to trip. Before continuing, delete the DestinationRule: kubectl delete destinationrule web-frontend Reset the metric counters: kubectl exec deploy/fortio -c istio-proxy -- \\ curl -X POST localhost:15000/reset_counters Outlier detection \u00b6 The circuit breaker is great when we want to protect the services from a sudden burst of requests. However, how can we protect the services in case of failures? For example, if we have a service that is still failing after multiple requests, it doesn't make sense to send even more requests to it. Instead, we can remove the instance of the failing service from the load balancing pool for a certain period of time. That way, we know that the requests will go to other instances of the service. After a pre-defined period of time, we can bring the failing service back into the load balancing pool. This process is called outlier detection . Just like in the connection pool settings, we can configure outlier detection in the DestinationRule. To see the outlier detection in action we need a service that is failing. We'll create a web-frontend-failing deployment and configure it to return HTTP 503 responses: Click for web-frontend-failing.yaml web-frontend-failing.yaml 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 apiVersion : apps/v1 kind : Deployment metadata : name : web-frontend-failing labels : app : web-frontend spec : replicas : 4 selector : matchLabels : app : web-frontend template : metadata : labels : app : web-frontend version : v1 spec : serviceAccountName : web-frontend containers : - image : gcr.io/tetratelabs/web-frontend:1.0.0 imagePullPolicy : Always name : web ports : - containerPort : 8080 env : - name : CUSTOMER_SERVICE_URL value : 'http://customers.default.svc.cluster.local' - name : ERROR_RATE value : '100' - name : ERROR_STATUS_CODE value : '500' Save the above YAML to web-frontend-failing.yaml and apply it to the cluster: kubectl apply -f web-frontend-failing.yaml If we run Fortio we'll see that majority (roughly, 80%) of the requests will be failing. That's because the web-frontend-failing deployment has more replicas than the \"good\" deployment. kubectl exec deploy/fortio -c fortio -- \\ fortio load -c 2 -qps 0 -n 50 -quiet web-frontend ... Code 200 : 9 (18.0 %) Code 500 : 41 (82.0 %) Let's look at an example of outlier detection configuration: outlier-web-frontend.yaml 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 apiVersion : networking.istio.io/v1alpha3 kind : DestinationRule metadata : name : web-frontend spec : host : web-frontend.default.svc.cluster.local trafficPolicy : outlierDetection : consecutive5xxErrors : 1 # (1) interval : 5s # (2) baseEjectionTime : 60s # (3) maxEjectionPercent : 100 # (4) Number of 5xx errors in a row that will trigger the outlier detection. The interval at which the hosts are checked whether they need to be ejected. The duration of time an outlier is ejected from the load balancing pool. If the same host is ejected multiple times, the ejection time increases by multiplying the base ejection time by the number of times the host is ejected. The maximum percentage of hosts that can be ejected. Save the YAML to outlier-web-frontend.yaml and apply it: kubectl apply -f outlier-web-frontend.yaml If we repeat the test, we might get a similar distribution of responses the first time. However, if we repeat the command (once the outliers were ejected), we'll get a much better distribution: kubectl exec deploy/fortio -c fortio -- \\ fortio load -c 2 -qps 0 -n 50 -quiet web-frontend ... Code 200 : 50 (100.0 %) The reason for more HTTP 200 responses is because as soon as the failing hosts were ejected (failing Pods from the web-frontend-failing deployment), the requests were sent to the other host that doesn't fail. If we waited until after the 60 second baseEjectionTime expired, the failing hosts would be brought back into the load balancing pool and we'd get a similar distribution of responses as before (majority of them failing). We can also look at the metrics from the outlier detection in the same way we did for the circuit breakers: kubectl exec deploy/fortio -c istio-proxy -- \\ pilot-agent request GET stats | grep web-frontend | grep ejections_total Produces output similar to this: cluster.outbound|80||web-frontend.default.svc.cluster.local.outlier_detection.ejections_total: 4 Note Other metrics that we can look at are ejections_consecutive_5xx , ejections_enforced_total or any other metric with outlier_detection in its name. The full list of metric names and their descriptions can be found in the Envoy documentation .

We can also look at the metrics from the outlier detection in the same way we did for the circuit breakers: kubectl exec deploy/fortio -c istio-proxy -- \\ pilot-agent request GET stats | grep web-frontend | grep ejections_total Produces output similar to this: cluster.outbound|80||web-frontend.default.svc.cluster.local.outlier_detection.ejections_total: 4 Note Other metrics that we can look at are ejections_consecutive_5xx , ejections_enforced_total or any other metric with outlier_detection in its name.

The services in our mesh are automatically made observable, without adding any burden on devops teams. Deploy the Addons \u00b6 The Istio distribution provides addons for a number of systems that together provide observability for the service mesh: Zipkin or Jaeger for distributed tracing Prometheus for metrics collection Grafana provides dashboards for monitoring, using Prometheus as the data source Kiali allows us to visualize the mesh These addons are located in the samples/addons/ folder of the distribution.

Take a moment to review the help information for the istioctl dashboard command: istioctl dashboard --help Generate a load \u00b6 In order to have something to observe, we need to generate a load on our system. Use a simple bash while loop to make repeated curl requests to the app: while true ; do curl -I http:// $GATEWAY_IP ; sleep 0 .5 ; done The curl requests will be running in foreground. It may be simplest to obtain a new shell prompt by opening a second, separate terminal.

Note The istioctl dashboard command also blocks. Leave it running until you're finished using the dashboard, at which time press Ctrl + C to interrupt the process and get back to the terminal prompt. The Kiali dashboard displays. Customize the view as follows: Select the Graph section from the sidebar. Under Select Namespaces (at the top of the page), select the default namespace, the location where the application's pods are running. From the third \"pulldown\" menu, select App graph . From the Display \"pulldown\", toggle on Traffic Animation and Security . From the footer, toggle the legend so that it is visible. Take a moment to familiarize yourself with the legend. Observe the visualization and note the following: We can see traffic coming in through the ingress gateway to the web-frontend , and the subsequent calls from the web-frontend to the customers service. The lines connecting the services are green, indicating healthy requests. The small lock icon on each edge in the graph indicates that the traffic is secured with mutual TLS. Such visualizations are helpful with understanding the flow of requests in the mesh, and with diagnosis. Feel free to spend more time exploring Kiali. We will revisit Kiali in a later lab to visualize traffic shifting such as when performing a blue-green or canary deployment. Kiali Cleanup \u00b6 Close the Kiali dashboard. Interrupt the istioctl dashboard kiali command by pressing Ctrl + C . Zipkin \u00b6 Launch the Zipkin dashboard: istioctl dashboard zipkin The Zipkin dashboard displays. Click on the red '+' button and select serviceName . Select the service named web-frontend.default and click on the Run Query button (lightblue) on the right. A number of query results will display. Each row is expandable and will display more detail in terms of the services participating in that particular trace. Click the Show button to the right of one of the traces having four (4) spans. The resulting view shows spans that are part of the trace, and more importantly how much time was spent within each span. Such information can help diagnose slow requests and pin-point where the latency lies. Distributed tracing also helps us make sense of the flow of requests in a microservice architecture. Zipkin Cleanup \u00b6 Close the Zipkin dashboard. Interrupt the istioctl dashboard zipkin command with Ctrl + C . Prometheus \u00b6 Prometheus works by periodically calling a metrics endpoint against each running service (this endpoint is termed the \"scrape\" endpoint). Developers normally have to instrument their applications to expose such an endpoint and return metrics information in the format the Prometheus expects. With Istio, this is done automatically by the Envoy sidecar. Observe how Envoy exposes a Prometheus scrape endpoint \u00b6 Run the following command: kubectl exec svc/customers -- curl -s localhost:15020/stats/prometheus \\ | grep istio_requests Why port 15020? See Ports used by Istio sidecar proxy. The list of metrics returned by the endpoint is rather lengthy, so we just peek at \"istio_requests\" metric. The full response contains many more metrics. Access the dashboard \u00b6 Start the prometheus dashboard istioctl dashboard prometheus In the search field enter the metric named istio_requests_total , and click the Execute button (on the right). Select the tab named Graph to obtain a graphical representation of this metric over time. Note that you are looking at requests across the entire mesh, i.e. this includes both requests to web-frontend and to customers . As an example of Prometheus' dimensional metrics capability, we can ask for total requests having a response code of 200: istio_requests_total{response_code=\"200\"} With respect to requests, it's more interesting to look at the rate of incoming requests over a time window. Try: rate(istio_requests_total[5m]) There's much more to the Prometheus query language ( this may be a good place to start). Grafana consumes these metrics to produce graphs on our behalf.

Preface \u00b6 Istio provides both a manual and an automatic mechanism for injecting sidecars alongside workloads. In this lab you will use the manual method, because it provides the opportunity to inspect the transformed deployment manifest even before applying it to a target Kubernetes cluster. You will learn about automatic sidecar injection in the next lab. Generate a Pod spec \u00b6 The kubectl command's dry-run flag provides a simple way to generate and capture a simple pod specification. Generate a Pod spec for a simple web server, as follows: kubectl run mywebserver --image nginx \\ --dry-run = client -oyaml > nginx-pod.yaml Inspect the contents of the generated file. Here it is below, slightly cleaned up: nginx-pod.yaml 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 --- apiVersion : v1 kind : Pod metadata : labels : run : mywebserver name : mywebserver spec : containers : - name : mywebserver image : nginx The main thing to note at this point is that this Pod spec consists of a single container using the image nginx . Transform the Pod spec \u00b6 The istioctl command provides the convenient kube-inject subcommand, that can transform such a specification into one that includes the necessary sidecar. Learn the kube-inject command's usage: istioctl kube-inject --help Use the command to generate and capture the full sidecar-injected manifest to a new file named transformed.yaml . Show me how istioctl kube-inject --filename ./nginx-pod.yaml > transformed.yaml Study the sidecar container specification \u00b6 The modified Pod specification now includes a second container. Here is the salient part: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 - name : istio-proxy image : docker.io/istio/proxyv2:1.18.2 args : - proxy - sidecar - --domain - $(POD_NAMESPACE).svc.cluster.local - --proxyLogLevel=warning - --proxyComponentLogLevel=misc:error - --log_output_level=default:info - --concurrency - \"2\" env : - ... The container name is istio-proxy and the docker image is istio/proxyv2 . What command is actually run? To find out what command actually runs inside that container, we can inspect the docker container specification and view the Entrypoint field: docker pull docker.io/istio/proxyv2:1.18.2 docker inspect istio/proxyv2:1.18.2 | grep Entrypoint -A 2 Here is the output: \"Entrypoint\" : [ \"/usr/local/bin/pilot-agent\" ], We learn that the name of the command is pilot-agent . By extracting the arguments from the yaml, we can reconstitute the full command executed inside the sidecar container: pilot-agent proxy sidecar \\ --domain $( POD_NAMESPACE ) .svc.cluster.local \\ --proxyLogLevel = warning \\ --proxyComponentLogLevel = misc:error \\ --log_output_level = default:info \\ --concurrency \"2\" Apply the manifest \u00b6 Deploy the transformed manifest to Kubernetes: kubectl apply -f transformed.yaml List pods in the default namespace kubectl get pod Once the pod reaches Running state, note the READY column in the output displays 2 out of 2 containers: NAME READY STATUS RESTARTS AGE mywebserver 2/2 Running 0 36s Study the running processes \u00b6 Run the ps command from inside the sidecar container, like so: kubectl exec mywebserver -c istio-proxy -- ps -ef Here is the output, slightly cleaned up, showing both the pilot-agent process, and the envoy process that it bootstrapped: PID PPID CMD 1 0 /usr/local/bin/pilot-agent proxy sidecar --domain ... 16 1 /usr/local/bin/envoy -c etc/istio/proxy/envoy-rev.json ... We can learn more about the pilot-agent command by running pilot-agent --help from inside the sidecar container: kubectl exec mywebserver -c istio-proxy -- pilot-agent --help Study the initContainers specification \u00b6 Besides injecting a sidecar container, the transformation operation also adds an initContainers section. Here is the relevant section: initContainers : - name : istio-init image : docker.io/istio/proxyv2:1.18.2 args : - istio-iptables - -p - \"15001\" - -z - \"15006\" - -u - \"1337\" - -m - REDIRECT - -i - '*' - -x - \"\" - -b - '*' - -d - 15090,15021,15020 - --log_output_level=default:info The \"initContainer\" uses the same image as the sidecar container: istio/proxyv2 . The difference lies in the command that is run when the Pod initializes.

Open a new terminal and apply the above resource to the cluster; it will overwrite the currently defined VirtualService as both yaml files use the same resource name. kubectl apply -f customers-vs-debug.yaml Test it \u00b6 Open a browser and visit the application. If you need it GATEWAY_IP = $( kubectl get svc -n istio-system istio-ingressgateway -ojsonpath = '{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}' ) We can tell v1 and v2 apart in that v2 displays not only customer names but also their city (in two columns). The user-agent header can be included in a request in a number of ways: Developer Tools curl Using a custom browser extension If you're using Chrome or Firefox, you can customize the user-agent header as follows: Open the browser's developer tools Open the \"three dots\" menu, and select More tools \u2192 Network conditions The network conditions panel will open Under User agent , uncheck Use browser default Select Custom... and in the text field enter debug Refresh the page; traffic should be directed to v2. curl -H \"user-agent: debug\" http:// $GATEWAY_IP Check out modheader , a convenient browser extension for modifying HTTP headers in-browser. Tip If you refresh the page a good dozen times and then wait ~15-30 seconds, you should see some of that v2 traffic appear in Kiali. Canary \u00b6 Well, v2 looks good; we decide to expose the new version to the public, but we're still prudent. Start by siphoning 10% of traffic over to v2. customers-vs-canary.yaml 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 --- apiVersion : networking.istio.io/v1alpha3 kind : VirtualService metadata : name : customers spec : hosts : - customers.default.svc.cluster.local http : - route : - destination : host : customers.default.svc.cluster.local subset : v2 weight : 10 - destination : host : customers.default.svc.cluster.local subset : v1 weight : 90 Above, note the weight field specifying 10 percent of traffic to subset v2 . Kiali should now show traffic going to both v1 and v2. Apply the above resource. In your browser: undo the injection of the user-agent header, and refresh the page a bunch of times. In Kiali, under the Display pulldown menu, you can turn on traffic distribution, to see how much traffic is sent to each subset. Most of the requests still go to v1, but some (10%) are directed to v2. Check Grafana \u00b6 Before we open the floodgates, we wish to determine how v2 is faring. istioctl dashboard grafana In Grafana, visit the Istio Workload Dashboard and specifically look at the customers v2 workload. Look at the request rate and the incoming success rate, also the latencies. If all looks good, up the percentage from 90/10 to, say 50/50. Watch the request volume change (you may need to click on the \"refresh dashboard\" button in the upper right-hand corner). Finally, switch all traffic over to v2. customers-virtualservice-final.yaml 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 --- apiVersion : networking.istio.io/v1alpha3 kind : VirtualService metadata : name : customers spec : hosts : - customers.default.svc.cluster.local http : - route : - destination : host : customers.default.svc.cluster.local subset : v2 After you apply the above yaml, go to your browser and make sure all requests land on v2 (2-column output). Within a minute or so, the Kiali dashboard should also reflect the fact that all traffic is going to the customers v2 service. Though it no longer receives any traffic, we decide to leave v1 running a while longer before retiring it.
