# Install Istio

In this lab you will install Istio.


## Download Istio

1. Run the following command from your home directory.

    ```{.shell .language-shell}
    curl -L https://istio.io/downloadIstio | ISTIO_VERSION={{istio.version}} sh -
    ```

1. Navigate into the directory created by the above command.

    ```{.shell .language-shell}
    cd istio-{{istio.version}}
    ```


## Add `istioctl` to your PATH

The `istioctl` CLI is located in the `bin/` subdirectory.

!!! note ":material-console:{.gcp-blue} Workaround for the Google Cloud Shell"

    Cloud Shell only preserves files located inside your home directory across sessions.

    This means that if you install a binary to a `PATH` such as `/usr/local/bin`, after your session times out that file may no longer be there!

    As a workaround, you will add `${HOME}/bin` to your `PATH` and place the binary there.


1. Create a `bin` subdirectory in your home directory:

    ```{.shell .language-shell}
    mkdir ~/bin
    ```

1. Copy the CLI to that subdirectory:

    ```{.shell .language-shell}
    cp ./bin/istioctl ~/bin
    ```

1. Add your home `bin` subdirectory to your `PATH`

    ```shell
    cat << EOF >> ~/.bashrc

    export PATH="~/bin:\$PATH"

    EOF
    ```

    And then:

    ```shell
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```

Verify that `istioctl` is installed with:

```{.shell .language-shell}
istioctl version
```

The output should indicate that the version is {{istio.version}}.

With the CLI installed, proceed to install Istio to Kubernetes.

## Pre-check

The `istioctl` CLI provides a convenient `precheck` command that can be used to "_inspect a Kubernetes cluster for Istio install and upgrade requirements._"

To verify whether it is safe to install Istio on your Kubernetes cluster, run:

```shell
istioctl x precheck
```

Make sure that the output of the above command returns a green "checkmark" stating that no issues were found when checking the cluster.

## Install Istio

1. Istio can be installed directly with the CLI:

    ```{.shell .language-shell}
    istioctl install
    ```

1. When prompted, enter `y` to proceed to install Istio.

Take a moment to learn more about [Istio installation profiles](https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/additional-setup/config-profiles/){target=_blank}.

## Verify that Istio is installed

Post-installation, Istio provides the command `verify-install`: it runs a series of checks to ensure that the installation was successful and complete.

Go ahead and run it:

```shell
istioctl verify-install
```

Inspect the output and confirm that the it states that "_âœ” Istio is installed and verified successfully._"

Keep probing:

1. List Kubernetes namespaces and note the new namespace `istio-system`

    ```{.shell .language-shell}
    kubectl get ns
    ```

1. Verify that the `istiod` controller pod is running in that namespace

    ```{.shell .language-shell}
    kubectl get pod -n istio-system
    ```

1. Re-run `istioctl version`.  The output should include a _control plane_ version, indicating that Istio is indeed present in the cluster.

## Next

With Istio installed, we are ready to deploy an application to the mesh.
